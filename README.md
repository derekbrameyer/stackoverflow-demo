StackOverflow API consumption app created as a demo project.  May move forward with it and try to make it more featureful.

To follow along with basic steps, follow the branches:

1. base
2. initialization (some basic renaming and styling)
3. api (creation of model classes and basic web queries, and a unit test)
4. search (implementation of the search function in a rudimentary form)

Where it goes from here is up to you...
